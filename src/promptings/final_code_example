The solution is organized into three modular functions:

1. `is_palindrome`:
   - This is the lowest-level utility function.
   - It checks whether a given string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.
   - Other modules depend on this function to perform palindrome checks.

2. `longest_palindromic_suffix`:
   - This is a mid-level helper function.
   - It iteratively finds the longest palindromic prefix in the input string.
   - It uses `is_palindrome` to determine if a substring is a palindrome, showcasing a clear dependency on the low-level module.
   - The output of this function provides the essential data for constructing the shortest palindrome.

3. `make_palindrome`:
   - This is the top-level function that integrates the other modules.
   - It first uses `is_palindrome` to check if the input is already a palindrome.
   - If not, it calls `longest_palindromic_suffix` to identify the necessary suffix to append.
   - Finally, it constructs and returns the shortest palindrome using the information provided by the lower-level functions.

This hierarchical structure (low-level utility -> mid-level helper -> top-level integrator) ensures that the solution is both modular and easy to maintain. Each function has a single responsibility, and the dependencies follow a logical flow, minimizing coupling.
